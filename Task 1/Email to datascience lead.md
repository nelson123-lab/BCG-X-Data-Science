Subject: Data Requirement and mitigation strategies for customer churn.
 
Dear Estelle,
 
I hope this email finds you well. I've recently delved into customer churn within the oil and gas industry, aiming to pinpoint factors influencing customer decisions. Here's a concise summary:
 
1) Key Reasons for Churn:
Factors include price, clean energy, customer service, location, usage trends, customer satisfaction, marketing effectiveness, and system quality.
 
2) Data Requirements:
We need historical purchasing trends, geographical data, pricing data, usage patterns, customer service metrics, growth metrics, marketing data, and system performance metrics.
 
3) Data Analysis and Visualization:
We'll plot price trends against churn, map geographical hotspots, analyze usage patterns, correlate customer service ratings with churn, assess marketing impact, and compare system reliability with satisfaction.
 
By applying these strategies, we can understand churn causes and develop mitigation plans.
 
Looking forward to discussing further.
 
Best regards,
Nelson Joseph
